prelude: >
    This is the first public release of the OpenStack Event Listener (OSEL).
    It had previously been a project within Comcast, but was open-sourced 
    under the Apache license.
features:
  - |
    Connects to RabbitMQ to listen for notification events specific to security
    group changes.  When those are intercepted, query Nova for information about
    what the affected IP addresses are, then initiate a Qualys scan.  Finally
    send info in the IP addresses and the Qualys scan ID to syslog.
issues:
  - |
    Only processes security group changes, should also process new port events 
    as well.
  - |
    Needs to exponential backoff for AMQP connections.
  - |
    Needs to be integrated with Aodh for modern OpenStacks.
security:
  - |
    Requires access to RabbitMQ as well as OpenStack credentials that have access
    to data in all projects, so this should be considered a privileged process and
    should be run in a properly secured context.
